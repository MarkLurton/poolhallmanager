# poolhallmanager

# Fun, small scale python project. Allows the user to manage a pool hall of 12 tables. Simply run pooltables.py from the terminal.
# The user can open a new table for players who want to start playing and close a table once players are done.
# The status of each table, start time, current time, update time, elapsed time, and cost of each table is kept in pt.xlsx
# The user can also refresh the manager to update pt.xlsx to the current time.
# When the user closes a table, a txt file will be created reporting the table, start and end times, time elapsed and cost
